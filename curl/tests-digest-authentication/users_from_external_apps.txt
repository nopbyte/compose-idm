#Get a session Id
curl -XGET http://localhost:8080/external_user_create/

#Get the image for the captcha (with a browser, it works too)
wget  http://localhost:8080/external_user_create/captcha/?session_id=893668764
#You will see the captcha file in index.html?session_id=893668764

#Send the request to create the user
curl  -H "Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8" -d '{"session_id": "1580137786", "captcha_text": "izahunefe", "username":"my_captcha_test","password":"pass"}' http://localhost:8080/external_user_create/


#Addtional aspects

If if the user didn't like the captcha image, it is possible to get a new one by executing the GET request to the /captcha endpoint as many times as he likes.


#Sync for the captcha.

If there is a POST request to the external_user_create/ endpoint trying to validate the 
captcha, regardless  of the output (verification successful or not) the value of the captcha 
is renewed.

As a result, when there is an unsuccessful attempt to create a user, the user must 
retrieve the captcha image and try to solve the new one.
